# HPW_MembraneDiffusion

MATLAB Code for implementing the series solutions to the membrane hydrodynamics equations of Hughes, Pailthorpe, and White (1981). 

The function HPW_drag.m calculates the translational and rotational drag and diffusion coefficients of a membrane inclusion, given input viscosities and the inclusion radius.  

HPW_fit.m calculates the best-fit membrane viscosity and inclusion radius, given (measured) rotational and translational diffusion coefficients.
